Hello again!

I was talking to a friend of mine on the golf course few days back, and he mentioned that his company recently implemented a logging server and that it has helped with responding to network alerts and keeping track of stuff.

So I think it would be a good idea if we did that as well. I'm not sure how long something like that takes, but try and get at least some of the servers logging within the next hour and a half or so!

Thank you!
