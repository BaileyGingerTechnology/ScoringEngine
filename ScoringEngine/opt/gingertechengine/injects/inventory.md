Hello,

Thank you so much for accepting this job to help us fix this environment! As mentioned in the previous email, all we really have been able to do is figure out something that vaguely resembles a network layout.
We need to know the systems and the services running on them. We also need a list of users on each system, their privileges, and any exposed ports. Weâ€™re on a time crunch, so we need this within the hour.

Thank you!
