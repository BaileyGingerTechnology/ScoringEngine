Welcome to Ginger Tech! Here you will find the injects given by the CEO/upper management. This is just an example one.

Typically, an inject will require you to complete some task that would be expected in a normal business environmet. Examples of this would be things like setting up a log server, taking inventory of servers, or creating acceptable use policies.

The first few injects are generally to accept rules and submit an example incident report, but I'll leave that up to instructors using this system.

There should be an inject already dropped asking for a system inventory, so get to it!

Instructors: there are sample injects in /opt/gingertechengine/injects. To add one to the system, edit the /opt/gingertechengine/js/injects.json file. Also, it is up to you to enforce time limits given by injects.
