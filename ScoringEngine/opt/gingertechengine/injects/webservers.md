Hello,

I'm pretty sure we have two primary web servers, one should be running Wordpress and the other should be running Nextcloud. Please identify these servers, which servers are hosting their databases, and that we can sign in to them.

Next make sure that they are actually working. It should be possible to connect to their main webpages and to sign in with the following credentials:

  - Wordpress is administrator:password
  - NextCloud is GingerTech:password

(Please change these after the first connection)

Provide proof that they are working via screenshots, and submit the write up in PDF format.

Thank you!
