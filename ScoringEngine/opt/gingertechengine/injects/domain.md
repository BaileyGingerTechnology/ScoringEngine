Hello,

It has come to my attention that we have a domain controller, but none of our systems are actually connected to it! I have no idea how this happened, but please connect our other Windows machines to it.

Since Blake is a workstation, I think that system should also authenticate with our domain controller, so get that one connected to please. That should be good for now, we can worry about the other systems later.

Please get this done within the hour.

Thank you!
